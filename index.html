                            <h2>Overview</h2>
                            <p>The Safewards Soft Words Application is a digital tool designed to support mental health nurses in implementing evidence-based de-escalation techniques. Based on the Safewards model (Mullen et al., 2022b), this application provides weekly scenarios with therapeutic communication strategies to reduce conflict and containment in mental health units.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Background on Safewards</h2>
                            <p>Safewards is an evidence-based model that identifies factors contributing to conflict and containment in mental health settings. The model includes ten interventions designed to reduce these incidents. One key intervention is "Soft Words" - the use of therapeutic, respectful language during challenging interactions with patients (Mullen et al., 2022b).</p>
                            <p>Research has shown that implementing Safewards interventions, including Soft Words, can significantly reduce conflict events and the use of restrictive practices in mental health units.</p>
